# SessionBox vs Antidetect Browser FAQ

**Q1: What is SessionBox?**

SessionBox is a browser extension and desktop app that lets you create multiple isolated sessions in a single browser. Each session has its own cookies and login data, allowing you to use multiple accounts without interference.

**Q2: How does SessionBox work?**

It clones your browsing environment and stores session data separately. Each tab or profile runs as an independent container, preventing sessions from mixing cookies or cache.

**Q3: Who is SessionBox designed for?**

It’s ideal for casual users, freelancers, or anyone who simply needs to run multiple accounts at once without switching browsers or logging in and out repeatedly.

**Q4: What are the main features of SessionBox?**

Key features include multi-session management, HTTP proxy assignment per profile, cloud sync across devices, profile sharing, and API access (for paid plans).

**Q5: Does SessionBox support proxies?**

Yes. SessionBox allows adding HTTP proxies to individual profiles. However, it does not support SOCKS proxies or auto-rotating proxies, which limits its flexibility for advanced users.

**Q6: How strong is SessionBox’s fingerprint and anti-detect protection?**

Very limited. It uses default browser fingerprints and offers almost no customization for Canvas, WebGL, fonts, timezone, hardware, or other identifiable parameters. This makes it easy for platforms to detect.

**Q7: How does SessionBox compare to an Antidetect Browser?**

Unlike SessionBox, [antidetect browser](https://hidemyacc.com/) is designed to mask browser fingerprints comprehensively. They allow deep customization of Canvas, WebGL, fonts, timezones, hardware profiles, and even user agents. Anti-detect browsers also support advanced proxy options (HTTP/SOCKS), automatic rotation, and are built for professional multi-account management, automation, and avoiding detection on sensitive platforms.

**Q8: Can platforms detect SessionBox profiles?**

Yes. SessionBox profiles are often detectable with advanced anti-fraud tools, whereas anti-detect browsers make it much harder to link accounts to the same user.

**Q9: Is SessionBox safe for sensitive work?**

Not recommended. For high-risk platforms like advertising networks, marketplaces, crypto, or financial services, its weak fingerprint protection makes it unsuitable.

**Q10: Does SessionBox sync across devices?**

Yes. Users can store profiles locally or sync them through SessionBox Cloud, enabling multi-device access.

**Q11: Does SessionBox offer API support?**

Yes, but only in paid plans. It provides API access for automation tools like Selenium, though its anti-detect limitations still apply.

**Q12: What are the main limitations of SessionBox?**

- Very weak anti-detect/fingerprint protection
- Limited proxy options (only HTTP)
- No automatic proxy rotation
- Basic documentation and support
- Not suitable for professional-scale operations

**Q13: Is SessionBox free?**

There is a free version with limited features. Advanced features such as cloud sync, API, and more profiles require paid plans.

**Q14: Is SessionBox suitable for professional multi-account work?**

Generally no. For heavy-duty tasks or sensitive operations, SessionBox is too limited. Anti-detect browsers are more suitable for these use cases.

**Q15: What’s the final verdict on SessionBox?**

SessionBox is a convenient, lightweight tool for simple multi-session browsing, but it lacks the advanced stealth, proxy flexibility, and fingerprint customization found in professional anti-detect browsers.
