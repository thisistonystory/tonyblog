## Multilogin Review with FAQ

Explore the top Multilogin FAQs - features, pricing, automation, and security explained. Learn how it compares to Hidemyacc and which antidetect browser fits your needs best.

**1, What is Multilogin used for?**

Multilogin is an advanced [antidetect browser](https://hidemyacc.com/) built for managing multiple online identities on one computer. It’s mainly used by digital marketers, eCommerce sellers, affiliate managers, and ad agencies who run multiple accounts on platforms like Facebook, Google, or TikTok. The tool isolates each profile so websites see every browser as a separate, genuine device - preventing bans or account linking due to shared fingerprints or IP addresses.

**2, How does Multilogin hide your real browser fingerprint?**

Every time you create a profile in Multilogin, the system generates a virtual fingerprint including details like user-agent, Canvas, WebGL, timezone, OS type, and fonts. This fingerprint mimics a real user’s environment, tricking detection systems into believing that every browser instance belongs to a different person. While this offers strong protection, users still need to combine it with unique proxies and cookies for the best anonymity results.

**3, Is Multilogin a cloud-based or desktop solution?**

Multilogin works as a desktop application but uses cloud synchronization to back up profiles. This hybrid structure gives users both control and flexibility - you run the app locally, but your fingerprints, cookies, and settings are safely stored on their servers.
It’s especially useful for teams that manage profiles across multiple devices or regions. Hidemyacc also adopts a similar sync approach but offers a faster startup and mobile access options.

**4, What browsers does Multilogin support?**

Multilogin features two proprietary browsers: Mimic (Chromium-based) and Stealthfox (Firefox-based).
Mimic is optimized for users familiar with Google Chrome’s interface, while Stealthfox is designed for those who prefer Firefox’s environment.
This dual-engine setup allows more flexibility, but users cannot switch to external browsers like Brave or Edge - something Hidemyacc supports natively.

**5, Does Multilogin support automation?**

Yes, but automation in Multilogin is code-oriented. Users can integrate through API, Selenium, or Puppeteer to automate repetitive tasks such as login, posting, or data scraping.
However, this requires some programming skill. For non-developers, automation can feel complex. In contrast, Hidemyacc offers built-in no-code automation - users can record, edit, and replay actions visually without writing a single line of code.

**6, How does Multilogin handle proxy connections?**

Each browser profile in [Multilogin](https://hidemyacc.com/multilogin-antidetect-browser) can be assigned its own proxy. The platform supports HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxies, helping users simulate different locations and IPs.
Profiles without proxies risk being flagged as linked.
Hidemyacc simplifies this with a built-in Proxy Hub, allowing users to import, test, and assign proxies instantly - including a free proxy marketplace integrated inside the dashboard.

**7, Is Multilogin suitable for team collaboration?**

Yes, but with limitations. Team features are available only on higher-tier plans, allowing members to share selected browser profiles, passwords, and proxy settings.
This system works well for agencies but can be restrictive for large teams since the number of shared slots is limited.
Hidemyacc’s collaboration tools are more open - it allows unlimited shared profiles and free sub-accounts, making teamwork much easier without extra fees.

**8, How secure is the data stored in Multilogin?**

Multilogin encrypts all local and cloud data using AES-256-bit encryption. Each profile’s cookies, sessions, and stored credentials are securely backed up to the cloud, reducing the risk of data loss.
However, users still bear responsibility for proxy safety and account practices - no antidetect browser can fully protect against phishing or platform bans.
Hidemyacc also provides daily automatic backups and fast restoration, which can be valuable when handling hundreds of active profiles.

**9, Does Multilogin offer a free trial or free plan?**

Multilogin provides a 10-day free trial so users can explore its features before committing. After the trial, subscriptions start around $99/month, scaling up with profile count and team seats.
There’s no permanent free version.
This makes it a premium option, better suited for established agencies or experienced users.
In contrast, Hidemyacc starts from $10/month or $5/month with an annual plan - offering a much lower barrier for entry-level users.

**10, Can Multilogin be used for social media or advertising accounts?**

Yes. It’s one of the main use cases. Marketers use Multilogin to manage multiple ad accounts across platforms like Facebook, Google Ads, TikTok, and X (Twitter).
Each profile behaves like a separate physical device, making it ideal for campaign testing, audience segmentation, or running multiple brands.
Still, users should stay compliant with each platform’s policies, as improper use of antidetect tools can violate terms of service.

**11, What are common reasons users switch from Multilogin to other tools?**

The main reasons include high monthly costs, limited automation options, and a steep learning curve.
Many users report that while Multilogin is stable and reliable, it’s not as convenient for quick setup or bulk operations.
For this reason, some users migrate to Hidemyacc, which provides similar fingerprint protection but adds automation, proxy management, and team sharing in one integrated system.

**12, How many profiles can I run simultaneously on Multilogin?**

It depends on your hardware and subscription. On most setups, you can open 10 to 100 profiles at the same time.
Heavy users with high RAM or SSDs may run more, but performance may drop when managing large numbers of sessions.
Hidemyacc’s lightweight core allows faster multi-profile launching and optimized memory usage, which helps when handling big campaigns.

**13, Does Multilogin provide customer support?**

Yes, Multilogin offers support through live chat, email, and an online help center.
Enterprise users receive onboarding sessions and dedicated technical assistance.
However, response times vary depending on your plan. Some users prefer Hidemyacc’s 24/7 customer support and active user community, which tend to provide faster responses.

**14, Can I import cookies or export profiles in Multilogin?**

Yes. Users can import cookies to preserve account sessions or export entire profile configurations for backup or sharing.
This is essential when migrating accounts between devices or team members.
Multilogin supports JSON and ZIP export formats. Hidemyacc adds an extra layer by allowing bulk import/export and one-click restoration directly within the interface.

**15, What are the main alternatives to Multilogin?**

Notable alternatives include Hidemyacc, GoLogin, and AdsPower.
Each tool serves a similar purpose but targets different audiences:
- Hidemyacc focuses on affordability, automation, and usability.
- [GoLogin](https://hidemyacc.com/gologin-antidetect-browser) caters to coders and tech-savvy users.
- [AdsPower](https://hidemyacc.com/adspower-browser) emphasizes team management and remote collaboration.
Among these, Hidemyacc is often highlighted as the most balanced option for both beginners and advanced users.
