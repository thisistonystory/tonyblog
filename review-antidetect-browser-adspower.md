## What AdsPower Offers

[AdsPower](https://hidemyacc.com/adspower-browser) is an antidetect browser available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides a free plan that includes up to five browser profiles, giving new users a way to explore its core features before upgrading.

It allows flexible fingerprint customization with two browser engines (SunBrowser based on Chromium, and FlowerBrowser based on Firefox). Users can choose among multiple operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, and can modify parameters such as language, fonts, screen resolution, and user agent. Cookies and extensions can be added to profiles, though extensions must be manually uploaded.

AdsPower also includes a proxy storage system where users can save and assign proxies to profiles. It supports HTTP, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies, though users must bring their own as no free proxies are built into the platform.

Team collaboration features are part of the platform, allowing you to create groups, set permission levels, and share or transfer profiles among teammates.

Another major highlight is its no-code automation tool. Users can build automation scripts by combining preset commands and can use the “Synchronizer” function to mirror actions across all open profiles, which is useful for running multiple accounts in parallel.

## What Works Well

AdsPower’s no-code automation is one of its biggest advantages, enabling even non-technical users to automate complex workflows. The Synchronizer saves time by replicating actions across profiles. Team features such as role-based permissions and profile sharing are helpful for small groups. Cross-platform compatibility ensures it can run on most systems, and the free tier makes it easy to try.

## Where It Falls Short

While powerful, AdsPower does have some limitations. The interface can be overwhelming for beginners because of its dense layout and many options. It does not provide free built-in proxies or exclusive discounts, meaning you must rely entirely on external proxy providers.

Extensions and bookmarks are limited - there is no built-in extension store or bookmark manager, and you must upload extensions manually. Profile import support from other antidetect browsers is also narrow, covering only a few specific tools.

The free plan is restrictive, and the full-featured trial requires payment, which can be inconvenient if you want to test the advanced capabilities before committing.

## How It Compares to Hidemyacc

Hidemyacc delivers similar core features fingerprint isolation, team tools, automation but is generally easier to use and more polished. It includes a built-in proxy marketplace, a larger extension library, and a “Magic Link” feature to import profiles from other antidetect browsers quickly.

While AdsPower can be cost-effective at certain tiers, Hidemyacc tends to offer more complete value with team seats, proxy discounts, and automation included even on lower plans, making it more appealing for both small teams and large enterprises.

## Verdict

AdsPower is a capable [antidetect browser](https://hidemyacc.com/), especially if you need cross-platform support, team collaboration, and simple automation without coding. It works well for social media managers or marketers who run multiple accounts and need to repeat the same tasks across them.

However, if you want a smoother interface, built-in resources like proxies and extensions, easier profile migration, and more inclusive pricing plans, Hidemyacc can be a stronger and more convenient choice overall.
