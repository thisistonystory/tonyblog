**Q1: What is Ghost Browser?**

Ghost Browser is a Chromium-based browser that allows users to manage multiple accounts and sessions in a single window, with each tab having its own cookies and cache. It’s widely used by marketers, social media managers, and freelancers.

**Q2: Is Ghost Browser an antidetect browser?**

No. Ghost Browser isolates sessions and cookies but does not hide or spoof your digital fingerprint. It does not mask hardware, Canvas, WebGL, or other browser identifiers.

**Q3: How does Ghost Browser help manage multiple accounts?**

It allows multiple “Identities” and “Workspaces,” each with separate cookies and cache, so you can log into different accounts without interference.

**Q4: Can Ghost Browser prevent account bans like an [antidetect browser](https://hidemyacc.com/)?**

Not fully. Without fingerprint protection, accounts are still at risk on platforms that detect device information or repeated logins.

**Q5: Does Ghost Browser support proxies?**

Yes. You can manually assign proxies per tab or Identity, but it lacks automatic proxy rotation and built-in proxy lists like some antidetect browsers.

**Q6: Which platforms does Ghost Browser support?**

Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Q7: Does Ghost Browser support Chrome extensions?**

Yes. Since it’s Chromium-based, it supports almost all extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

**Q8: What are the main features of Ghost Browser?**

- Multi-Session/Identity: separate cookies and cache per session
- Workspaces: save tabs and sessions by project
- Proxy Control (Pro version)
- Chrome extension compatibility
- Basic automation and API support

**Q9: Does Ghost Browser protect fingerprints?**

No. Only the User-Agent and proxies can be changed. Other identifiers such as Canvas, WebGL, WebRTC, language, and hardware remain the same.

**Q10: How does Ghost Browser compare with true antidetect browsers?**
Ghost Browser isolates sessions and cookies but does not spoof fingerprints, IPs, or device info. Antidetect browsers like Hidemyacc, [Gologin](https://hidemyacc.com/gologin-antidetect-browser) provide full profile management to mimic different devices for each session.

**Q11: Can Ghost Browser be used safely for marketing and social media campaigns?**

It’s useful for managing multiple accounts quickly, but for sensitive campaigns where detection matters, an antidetect browser is recommended.

**Q12: What are the pros of Ghost Browser?**

Easy to use, supports multiple accounts, Chrome extensions, Workspaces for projects, and basic proxy support.

**Q13: What are the cons of Ghost Browser?**

No full fingerprint protection, manual proxy setup, limited automation, and less secure for platforms monitoring device information.

**Q14: What are the pricing plans of Ghost Browser?**
- Free Plan: basic features
- Basic Plan: $21/month (billed annually)
- Pro Plan: $46/month, with Proxy Control and priority support
- Enterprise: custom pricing for businesses

**Q15: Are there better alternatives for users who need full antidetect capabilities?**

Yes. Hidemyacc is a modern alternative offering independent browser profiles, fingerprint protection, automation API, proxy management, and enhanced security for multi-account operations.
