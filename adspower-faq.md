**7. What is AdsPower browser fingerprint?**
The browser fingerprint is the unique set of data (User Agent, OS, Time Zone, WebGL, Fonts, etc.) that a website reads from your browser to identify you. AdsPower's core function is to let you spoof or customize this fingerprint for every profile, making each one appear as a unique, legitimate device.

**8. How to use AdsPower RPA automation?**
AdsPower's RPA (Robotic Process Automation) allows you to automate repetitive tasks (like mass registration or posting) using a **no-code visual editor**. You typically record actions on one profile, then use the editor to refine the workflow (adding loops or variables), and finally run the script across multiple profiles in bulk.

**9. Can I share AdsPower profiles with my team?**

If a proxy connection fails, you should:
* **Check Credentials:** Verify the proxy Host, Port, Username, and Password for errors.
* **Test Separately:** Use a third-party tool to confirm the proxy IP itself is working and online.
* **Verify Type:** Ensure the selected Proxy Type (HTTP/SOCKS5) in AdsPower matches your proxy's protocol.
* **Local Network Check:** Temporarily disable your local VPN/Firewall to rule out interference.
